  - Yo Boy!
  - You finally come! This place has been lost.
  - You see those lil monsters? Try "W, A, S, D" to move around and disperse them.
  - They have puzzles from different dimension useful to you but they won't drop
    them unless you frighten them into the trap.
  - Puzzles are the way to the truth in a mysterious dimension. Press "M" to access
    that dimension.
  - Find enough puzzles and get a way out of here, kid. Let's see how special you
    are.
